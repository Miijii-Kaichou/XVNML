		@Hann>Neutral {sts::60}Hello!<
		@Hana>Happy If you are reading this{del::750|n|ins::"GREAT JOB!"}<
		@* Now, it's time to incoporate Cast data{del::500}, such as what emotion{n}
		they are showing{del::500}, or how they sound!<
		@* This will be a new chapter in our XVNML journey!
		{n}We'll be going over the following concepts:
		{n|w|bul1|w|ins::"Dialogues"|del::500|n
		|w|bul1|w|ins::"Prompts"|del::500|n
		|w|bul1|w|ins::"Prompts"|paren|ins::"Input"|paren_end|del::500|n
		|w|bul1|w|ins::"Cast Signatures"|del::500|n
		|w|bul1|w|ins::"Cast Definitions"|del::500|n

		@* I don't even know how far I can even take this.<
		@* There's a lot of stuff that we have to consider{n}
		when it comes to implementing the Cast Expressions and Voices.<
		@* First is the actually stashing of the current cast.<
		@* As I last checked{del::500}, the DialogueLine only has{n}
		information for the Name{del::500}, the Expression{del::500}, and Voice{del::500}, but not necessarily{n}
		the Cast that this dialogue pertains to.<
		@* The CLOSEST information that we got on{del::500|ins::" THAT"|del::500} is the{n}
		CastSignatureInfo that's attached to the DialogueLine...{del::500|clr}
		But nothing more.< 
		@* So we're going to have to do some refactoring on our DialogueLine...{del::500|n}
		to make sure that we're able to have access to the Cast.<
		@* That way{del::250}, when we need to change expressions, we can tell the Cast associated with the DialogueLine{n}
		to change expressions {paren}and{slash}or voice{paren_end|del::500|n}
		and then do the proper callbacks!<
		@* The last thing we need to consider{del::500} is the actual raw data of the image and audio files.<
		@* We want to be able to take those bytes{del::500}, and have it be converted to a specific type.<
		@* We want to try to limit the heavy-lifting for the person using this tool{del::500|n}
		but honestly{del::500}, that's our goal!<
		@* We want to make creating Visual Novels{del::500} and Story-Centric games{del::500} as easy as possible to implement!<
		@* So with that said{del::1000} let's get on with it!<<
