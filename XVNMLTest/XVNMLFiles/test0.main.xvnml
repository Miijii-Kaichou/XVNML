        @* It's evident that this forest is losing it's magus reserves.<
        @Hana Which is why you're not allowed!< 
        @Hana Hmph!<
        @* You're such a dummy!<
        @Raven ???<<
        @??? A HUMAN!<
        @??? Hello human!<
        @Ageha I'm Ageha! Equinoxist of Summer!<
        @* Welcome to our beloved home!<
        @Raven Hello.<
        @* I am Raven Lilac of the Lilac Cult.<
        @* How long have the inhabitants been struggling from this endeavour?<
        @Ageha I honestly have no idea!<
        @* But the others told me that we were in serious trouble!<
        @* If I were to see any humans, I were to drive them out!<
        @Raven I can not blame you. Conduct your duties as promptly.<
        @Ageha Wow! You're so strong!<
        @Raven The situation must be more dire than I've preceived.<
        @* I may be able to do something about it.<
        @??? Sister, look!<
        @??? Was this the human that Ageha was talking about?<
        @??? She's absolutely elegant.<
        @Raven More nymphs...<
        @* Their sizes counts me as astonishing.<
        @* Especially these two.<
        @??? Ageha came running to us saying {quot}I meet a human, and she was soooo strong!.<
        @??? You guys will definitely have a really hard time with her!{quot}<
        @??? It seems she was right.<
        @??? Unfortunately, as mush as we want you to stay, we have an obligation to drive any suspected bodies away from our home.<
        @Konoha I'm Konoha, Equinoxist of Autumn.<
        @Urara I'm Urara, Equinoxist of Winter, elegantly so.<
        @Konoha Leave, or prepare to meet your end!<<
        @Urara Ageha was right...<
        @* She is quite elegantly formitable.<
        @Konoha Seems there's no pursuading her.<
        @* I wish to not fight her again to be honest.<
        @Raven This forest is really on high alert.<
        @* Not only that, but there's been 4 highly developed nymphs so far...<
        @* There must be a very powerful influence.<
        @Konoha Seems you've fail to heed our warning...<
        @??? Hiiii!<
        @??? No need for hostility.<
        @??? It's very nice to meet you human.<
        @Silka My name is Silka Mei, and I'm the protector of this forest.<
        @* Tell me, what brings you here to our home?<
        @Raven Simply passing by...<
        @* Though I couldn't help seeing your home in a dire situation.<
        @Silka Ever since the Magus Disturbance occured, our plants have simply wilted away.<
        @* Leaves falling prematurally...<
        @* It's a dire situation indeed.<
        @* Who must you be?<
        @Raven Name's Lilac, member of the Lilac Cult.<
        @Silka As I expected!<
        @* That would make you a witch.<
        @* My sisters have told me a lot about you.<
        @Ageha A Witch?!<
        @* No wonder she was so strong!<
        @Urara And elegant might I had.<
        @Silka Yes. She is quite well dignified.<
        @* I've definltey recognized your attire, but that was eons ago.<
        @Hana I didn't know Witches were real...<
        @* I've heard stories from Silka...<
        @* But we've personally never encountered them before.<
        @Silka Sorry for the chaos.<
        @* Me and my sisters mean no ill will.<
        @* I see all creatures as good.<
        @* Though, I suppose Mother Nature would know best after all...<
        @* These turn of events have really been Unfortunate.<
        @* Since you're here, we should put together a welcome party.<
        @* It's the least we can do since you'll be the last to be here.<
        @Hana Please don't take this personally.<
        @Konoha We'll be sure to have you fall as gracefully as the autumn leaves.<
        @Urara Elegantly I might add!<
        @Ageha Yay! We get to play with the Witch!<
        @Hana I don't think now's the time for that...<<
        @Silka It's as they say.<
        @* Witches are indeed very powerful...<
        @* Especially of the Lilac Cult.<
        @Raven I wish to not continue this.<
        @Silka I understand.<
        @* Mother Nature knows best after all.<
        @* But this place is very special.<
        @* Saying that I'm it's protected is an understatement.<
        @* That would simply do you an injustice.<
        @* I'll rid of anything and everything...<
        @* No matter the moral spectrum.<
        @* This is something that has been entrusted by someone very important to me...<
        @* And I can never break her promise.<
        @Silka I suppose we can't best you at all.<
        @Raven My apologizes.<
        @* I didn't mean to cause any distubance.<
        @Silka It's quite alright.<
        @* Though, I don't know what to make of the situation.<
        @* Was the Blessing of Mother Nature not enough...<
        @* To protect our home?<
        @Ageha Sis, please don't be sad.<
        @Hana Silka.<
        @Silka I'm alright.<
        @* I can't not afford to be sad.<
        @* We'll continue as we are to protect what was almost lost.<
        @Urara A blessing we can never lose.<
        @Konoha A paradise that can never fall.<
        @Raven ...<
        @* This forest...<
        @* Is that precious to you...<
        @Silka Centries ago, this forest was on the verge of collapse.<
        @* Perhaps far worse than how it already is...<
        @* But a young maiden quite like yourself came along.<
        @* A dryad on the verge of death...<
        @* I was so weak back them.<
        @* Bless her kinded soul.<
        @* She was the blessing that we needed most.<
        @* A blessing Mother Nature knew was the answer.<
        @* As she stayed, she cured me of my aliments...<
        @* then bestowed me a name.<
        @* She left a promise to me, which my gift shall I further protect our home.<
        @* I can never forget that day.<
        @* I've then give life to my sisters and bestowed them names as well.<          
        @Raven I see.<
        @* You were given so much from her...<
        @* Enough to even part from your own tree.<
        @* Enough to give strength to your sisters.<
        @Silka You know of Dryads?<
        @Raven Enough so.<
        @* It presents me more the reason to assist.<
        @* At least to give me enough time to resolve this matter.<
        @Silka You say you will help us.<
        @Raven I couldn't help but notice how much the magus distubance is drawing all the life from this forest.<
        @* I should have enough to aid you and restore this forest to once it was.<
        @* If that's alright with you.<
        @Silka You mustn't.<
        @Raven Leaving it be would be a grave disservice.<       
        @Konoha So does that mean our home will last forevermore?<
        @Urara Elegant as you are kind.<
        @Hana Thank you, Miss. Raven!<
        @Ageha Many, many thanks Big Sis!<
        @Silka Hehe!<
        @* ...<
        @* When I look in to your eyes, you remind me a lot about her.<
        @* Loving, compassionate, strong, beautiful.<
        @* We are forever in your debt.< 
        @* Please do come back once you've completed your task.<
        @* We'll have a proper welcome party.<
        @* But without the farewell.<
        @Ageha Please come back, Big Sis!<   
        @Hana Please come back... And be safe as well...<
        @* Big sis...<
        @Urara How extravagant! We have a new big Sister!< 
        @Konoha It would seem.<
        @* We wish you save travels.<
        @Silka With Mother Nature's embrace, shall she aid in your endeavours.<
        @Raven I can sense the Day of Renascence hastily approaching.<
        @* I need to make it to the source, post haste.<
        @* But this rubble...<
        @* Was it once an ancient civilization brought to ruin?<<
        @* ...<
        @* Such a sad sight.<
        @* It could be the last thing that I'll ever see.<
        @??? Hold it there, suspection entity!<
        @??? What are you doing in the Realm of Heroes?<
        @??? State your business, and address yourself promptly.<
        @Raven Name's Raven.<
        @* I'm simply passing over your land to address an important matter.<
        @??? You've got some vendeta against Orighd?<
        @??? Might you be the cause of the atrocities happening across all over the Far Land of Magic?<
        @Raven You must jest.<
        @* I'm not the one causing this phenomenon.<
        @* A witch is on the verge of rebirth.<
        @* A very powerful one.<
        @??? I, I see...<
        @??? I thought as much.<
        @??? My blade has told me that you're not the culprit.<
        @??? I simply can't sense any malice in you.<  
        @Anemelle My name is Anemelle Lumen, a bearer of Hyromagnda, the Holy Sword.<
        @* A noble by serventhood of the Kingdom of Lorrim.<
        @* And also among the strongest of soceress over the land.<
        @Raven Hyromagnda...<
        @* I've definitely heard the name in ancient scriptures.<   
        @Anemelle I sense that your business that you have in the Realm of Heroes is valid, Witch of the Lilac Cult.<
        @* Although you have no malice towards Orighd, as the highest order of the Holy Knights...<
        @* I must uphold my duties as such.<
        @* Though why have interest in this witch soon to reborn?<
        @* Us Holy Knights have everything taken care of.<
        @* There's no need for intervention.<
        @Raven As a Witch myself, I have an obligation to settle this matter as a single body.<
        @* The longer this proceeds, this land will face far worse atrocities.<
        @* Worse than the ancient wars combined.<
        @Anemelle It's as if you know so much about the situation.<
        @* Were you perhaps allies with this person?<
        @* An enemy perhaps?<
        @* What unfound powers do they hold?<
        @* How can the banished even be revived as such?<
        @* You must tell me, at once!<
        @Raven I bare no time for interrogations.<
        @Anemelle ...<
        @* I see...<
        @* Well, my deepest apologies.<
        @* But the time to reconsider is now!<
        @* The path you are taking is sacred ground.<
        @* As I've said, Mount Saintere is watch-guarded.<
        @* Even if you pass me, it's deemed unreachable.<
        @* Especially those deriving from the wicked.<
        @* Such as the one before you.<
        @* You'll most certainly die in vain, whatever your plans might of been.<
        @Raven You seem very capable.<
        @* Why did you not stop her?<
        @* Cooperations seems imminate.<
        @* Please, I ask you to go back from once you came.<
        @* Or show your resolve, right here, and now!<<       
        @Anemelle Astounding!<
        @* Your Crystal magic is impeccible!<
        @* Much expected for a member of the Lilac Cult.<
        @* But you're so much different from any Witch I've encountered.<
        @Raven ...<
        @* You're acknowledgement is very much appreciated...<
        @* However...> I wish to cast aside such notions.<
        @Anemelle ...<
        @* My apologizes, Raven Lilac.<
        @* How inconsiderate of me to disregard your feelings.<
        @* The blade speaks of your kindness...<
        @* But bares no answers.<
        @Raven My standing as a Witch was already determined at birth.<
        @* The life in which I should live is not of my own.<
        @* What I've done can't never be reconciled.<
        @* Time only moves forward.<
        @* So, whilest I still have my humanity, I wish to give and not take.<
        @* For the sake of my humanity of which hangs by a thread.<
        @* Resolve this issue will stand as my atonement.<
        @Anemelle A selfish do-gooder.<
        @* I suppose fate is your enemy?<
        @* ...<
        @* So strong... so admirable.<
        @* This was bestowed upon me by the King's Advisor of Lorrim.<
        @* The Hyromagnda knows, and so do I.<
        @* And since that day, deep inside...<
        @* I felt the need to protect this land.<
        @* ...<
        @* It pains me... so much so.<
        @* This knowledge I bare should be sin.<
        @* In honesty, I don't know what to make of this world.<
        @* I know the feeling... of fate deeming antagonistic.<
        @* Bearing the Hyromagnda means becoming the new heir of Bezzelet...<
        @* The rubble that stands before us.<
        @* Despite my status and sheer strange, I can't help but ponder...<
        @* If I'm fit to liberate, rebuild, and become queen of once an ancient civilization.<
        @* With this strength, who am I to fight for?<
        @* The current King and his advisor have done so much for me.<
        @* Would standing before you now and exchanging words of passion be an act of treason...<
        @* Despite witnessing with the greatest of sight that your humanity is plattered in gold...<
        @* A Cardinal Sin?<
        @* I beared these insecurites for so long...<
        @* However, how can fate be the enemy if it has gifted me the greatest thing in the world?<
        @* With every ounce of our essence clashing...<
        @* Comparing your troubles through my sword is immeasurable.<
        @* The mainly young maiden that could frolic through these fields...<
        @* Are instead stripe of their being... their humanity...<
        @* Their freedom...<
        @* I felt it from the young maiden before you.<
        @* However, through my blade, I fear that her actions may lead to distruction.<
        @Raven Indeed.<
        @Anemelle Raven Lilac, as one who bares a marker of a Witch, you must assure that 
        the young maiden strays from that aura.<
        @* With your resolve and humanity proven...<
        @* You are the only one to stop her.<
        @Raven ...<
        @Anemlle Over there... Is your next destination.<
        @* Mount Saintere is a sacred place...<
        @* It is said to be the Origin of all magic.<
        @* It may take you several moons to reach...<
        @* But as you know, it's not a place for the wicked.<
        @* It's highly guarded by the Holy Knights, as natural.<
        @* However, it's likely that They will be guarding it as well...<
        @* Please, conduct your deed with the likelihood that paint will show.<
        @Raven Understood.<
        @Anemelle ...<
        @* And please...<
        @* Whenever you do return...<
        @* And I am able to restore these ruins to its former glory and more...<
        @* I would like you to be by my side.<
        @Raven ...<
        @Raven Thank you.<
