        @ {sts::100}You notice that it's just the {quot|at|quot} symbol when stating a 
        Declarative Role on a Skriptr line.<
        @ However, if you've defined Cast members within your XVNML project...<
        @ You can set them as a speaker!<
        @ For example...<
        @??? {cue_cast::("Hana","Center")}Hello!<
        @* My name is Hana!<
        @Hana>Happy {react::"Jump"}It's very nice to meet you!<
        @ Anything after and before actual dialogue is known as the Cast Signature.<
        @ If you look at Line 121, this is considered a Normal Cast Signature.<
        @ It's the most common signature that you'll see inside an XVNML document.<
        @ Anything without a name is considered a Narrative Cast Signature.<
        @ As the name suggests, it's meant to denote that the Narrator is speaking.<
        @ If there's a {quot|qm|qm|qm|quot} in place of the name...<
        @ This is known as the Anonymous Cast Signature.<
        @ And anything with an {quot|aster|quot} is consider a Persistent Cast Signature.<
        @ The general format of a Cast Signature is the following...<
        @ {tag|brack|at|pipe|qm|brack_end|tag}NULL
        {tag_end|pipe|brack}Cast
        {brack_end|pipe|aster|pipe|qm|qm|qm|tag_end|brack}Expression
        {brack_end|tag_end|brack}Voice
        {brack_end|tag_end}<
        @ It's definitely a lot to keep up with, but that's what the XVNMLEssentials guide is for...<
        @ To help you get in touch with XVNML.<
