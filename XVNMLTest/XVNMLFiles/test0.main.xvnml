        @ {sts::100}I honestly have no idea why I can't read my elements inside Unity.<
        @ Today, our job is to figure that out.<
        @ Because if I can get caching to work, then it's going to greatly improve 
        perform, especially when you create a stand-alone build of the game.<
        @ So without further ado, let's begin the test.<
        @ {set_text_speed::40}Welcome to XVNML2U!<
        @ This package demonstrates the capabilities in which the XVNML{space}
        Class Library is capable of{delay::500|clr}when used with the Unity Game Engine.<
        @ What you see here{delay::750} is a normal dialogue.<
        @ And {insert::"THIS"|delay::1000} is a dialogue with {set_text_speed::60} a 
        looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of {set_text_speed::30}charisma!!!!<
        @ {set_text_speed::40}And with a normal XVNML Dialogue Control component, you can run whatever 
        dialogue you want.<
        @ This is just a sample of what XVNML can do.<
        @ XVNML is a powerful tool with an EMPHASIS in story telling.<
        @ And we're starting our journey off by integrating XVNML to Unity 
        {paren}hence "XVNML2U"{paren_end}.<
        @ We're very excited to see how you'll put this tool to the ultimate test.<
        ?  What's boning on?>>
        (
            ("Nothing")>
                @  I see.<<

		["CL"]
        @ {sts::100|del::1000}We hope that you've enjoyed this demo.<
        @ Please consider loading the other Unity Scenes to 
        get a more in-depth explanation on the different tools and features
        that XVNML and XVNML2U can provide.<
        @ {lindex::false}With that said, logging out!<<
