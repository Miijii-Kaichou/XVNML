		@Hana>Smile {sts::60}I've just received some great news!<
		@*>Happy>Wow You definitely want to hear this.> 
		Because this will change the way how we use XVNML2U from here on.<
		@*>Smile It's a feature that XVNML2U definitely needed.<
		@* And the feature in question...<
		?* Can you guess?{pause}>>
		(
			("Based on what I'm seeing, it looks like we've implemented prompts...")>

				$> It's best practice that at every start of a prompt response
				$> you start with a Normal Cast Definition (@[cast_name]) as opposed to a

			@Hana No, silly!<<

			("Does it have something to do with Unity?")>
			@Hana Actually,{del::500} it does have something to do with Unity.<
			@* More specifically,{del::500} it has something to do with the updated XVNML API
			that can be implemented to Unity.<<
		)
		@*>Happy IT'S PROMPTS!!!<
		@*>Smile We're in the process of taking the updated XVNML API and implementing prompts for you.<
		@* The user should be able to type in a prompt{pause}, and inside the game, you can click on the different responses.<
		@* From then, you can then have branching dialogues that does different things!<
		@*>Happy A feature that's essential for creating Visual Novels!<
		?*>Smile So tell me, how do you think about XVNML2U so far?>>
		(
			("It's pretty awesome!")>
			@Hana>Happy>Wow That's great to hear!<<

			("I'm not too sure yet...")>
			@Hana Well, this isn't all that XVNML2U can offer.<
			@* Give it a couple of months{pause}, it'll come out super special.<
			@*>Happy I promise you that!<<

			("It could do better")>
			@Hana Well of course it can.<
			@* We're only beginning to scratch the service.<
			@* Eventually, it'll be a tool that will change how people does 
			story-centric content inside Unity.<
			@*>Happy You can bet your lucky stars on that one.<<
		)
		@*>Smile In the future, we'll be about to do 
		a lot more with XVNML2U.<
		@* Like Cast Reactions, playing audio {paren}not including Cast Voices{paren_end},
		moving cast to a position of the screen...<
		@* Scene loading and transitions, Text Motions...<
		@*>Happy>Wow And so much more!!!<
		@*>Smile If you made it this far...<
		@*>Happy Then we've officially implmented prompts!<
		?Hana>Smile What do you want to do today?>>
		(
			("Create more visual novels...")>
				@Hana>Happy Good choice!<
				@* I actually have a really great story idea!<
				@* Want to hear it?<<
			("Hang out with you...")>
				@Hana>Happy Hehe!<
				@* That's very sweet!<
				@* Let's hang out then!<<
			("Sleep...")>
				@* You must be tired then.<
				@* I'll always be here if you want to do anything!<<
